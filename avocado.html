                    Ever wondered how a humble green fruit became <a
                        href="https://www.fruitnet.com/eurofruit/why-have-avocados-become-so-popular/172578.article">the reigning champion of
                        brunches,</a> the muse of countless Instagram feeds, and the subject of heated debates over guacamole recipes? Or questioned whether the deposit on your 2 bedroom basement flat could've been spent a little differently?
                        Ok, maybe you haven't, but I know you're now thinking about it.

                    <br>
                    Lets start simple. Its useful to gauge an understanding on
                    the changes in house prices across the UK before we can begin to relate this to our beloved green friends. Using  <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/housepriceindex/latest">ONS Data</a>
                    we can easily tell that there has been a steady increase in house prices. It's clear to see that as time progresses, the house price range widens and diverges from the regression line, indicating an increasing variability or dispersion of the data points over time.
                    We call this <strong>heteroscedasticity.</strong> As time goes on, the variability of the data points (residuals) around the regression line increases, indicating heteroscedasticity. In 1968, the data is clustered, which is the complete opposite in 2021.By hovering over the data points, we can see which regions the data aligns to. More on this later...
                   <br>
                    <br>
                    An R<sup>2</sup> value of of 0.66 means that approximately 66% of the variation in average house prices can be explained by the date variable in the regression model. In other words, this suggests that about 66% of the fluctuations or changes observed in average house prices over time can be attributed to the chronological progression of dates in the dataset.

                <p>
                    Reported incidents of fatal and non-fatal shootings collected from the <a
                        href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/"> Chicago Data Portal</a>
                    are shown at neighbourhood
                    levels on an interactive map. Austin, which is Chicago's largest neighbourhood, located far from
                    the city centre,
                    suffers from the most reported gun crimes out of all the neighbourhoods, accounting for 8% of all
                    reported crimes in the 77 neighbourhoods between 2014-22.

            <h2>Mapping income disparities</h2>

            <div class="para">
                <p>
                    Austin has long suffered from severe disinvestment because of white flight, making it a hub of
                    concentrated poverty, shown by its drastically different income distribution than to the City of
                    Chicago. But can poverty be a predictor of gun violence? In the maps below, we can see that
                    neighbourhoods with high gun crimes tend to have lower incomes, but the South-East of Chicago sees
                    low median incomes with relatively low reported gun crimes.
                    <br><br>
                    Social mobility is also mapped, seeing if children who grew up with parents in the lowest 25th
                    percentile of national income
                    distribution can escape poverty. The results here fit the gun crime map more consistently. Climbing
                    up the economic ladder is harder. The once since achievable American Dream is just a fantasy for
                    many people in Chicago, and
                    <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002978">across
                        America</a>. Structural inequalities, often rooted in racism, mean marginalised individuals are
                    more likely to live in
                    hyper segregated poor neighbourhoods with limited economic opportunity, fuelling gun violence.

                    Socioeconomic disparities across Chicago are not limited to income. Educational attainment and
                    children receiving food stamps is mapped below. Exposure to gun violence can detrimentally affect
                    students' educational attainment, further reducing their economic opportunities, creating a cycle of
                    violence for already suffering communities. High poverty concentration can have detrimental
                    implications, increasing the<a

                    and as tracts in Austin have over 50%
                    of households with children under 18 receiving government Food Stamps, the neighbourhood is
                    especially vulnerable to youth related gun violence.

                <h2>Data Challenges</h2>
                <p>
                    Due to the GVA's database query method, only 2000 rows of data could be collected at a time. A data
                    analysist hand
                    <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jasonmobley/united-states-gun-violence-data-20142022">

                        hand
                        cleaned</a> the rest.
                    Data cleaning overcame the issue of city names not being the same in both data sets
                    and aggregated daily statistics into annual data.
                    <br> <br>
                    I initially used <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html">API keys</a>
                    for the US census bureau data to <a
                        href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1G_yu9nRhShIL_Dv6UgnNsI2rnJ1wrAru?usp=sharing">plot
                        poverty rates</a>.
                    However, the household median income dataset was easily accessible to be downloaded from the
                    advanced database.
                    <br> <br>
                    As lower upward mobility <a
                        href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002978"> is linked
                        to gun violence</a>,
                    the <a href="https://opportunityinsights.org/">Opportunity Insights</a>
                    estimations of income by parental income is very useful.

                    Census tracts in the North-East of Chicago have missing data for social mobility, which is a
                    limitation.
                    However, as this contains the richest neighbourhoods, with high educational attainment, and
                    relatively low levels of gun violence, it is not the target of this research.

                <h2>Conclusions</h2>
                <p>
                    Patterns between high levels of gun violence and low social mobility can be seen geographically in
                    Chicago.
                    However, causality may not necessarily be taken, as socioeconomic measures and gun violence may be
                    two-way causal. Nonetheless, the research here provides beneficial insight into the
                    impacts and causes of gun violence, a pressing issue which deserves further exploration.
