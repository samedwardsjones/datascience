            <h4>Avocado Toast or a 3 Bedroom House? <br> The Greatest Debate of 2024 (so far)</h4>
            <div class="para">
                <P>
                    Ever wondered how a humble green fruit became <a
                        href="https://www.fruitnet.com/eurofruit/why-have-avocados-become-so-popular/172578.article">the reigning champion of
                        brunches,</a> the muse of countless Instagram feeds, and the subject of heated debates over guacamole recipes? Or questioned whether the deposit on your 2 bedroom basement flat could've been spent a little differently?
                        Ok, maybe you haven't - but I know you are now.
                        
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    Lets start simple. Its useful to gauge an understanding on
                    the changes in house prices across the UK before we can begin to relate this to our beloved green friends. Using  <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/housepriceindex/latest">ONS Data</a>
                    we can easily tell that there has been a steady increase in house prices. It's clear to see that as time progresses, the house price range widens and diverges from the regression line, indicating an increasing variability or dispersion of the data points over time.
                    We call this <strong>heteroscedasticity.</strong> As time goes on, the variability of the data points (residuals) around the regression line increases, indicating heteroscedasticity. In 1968, the data is clustered, which is the complete opposite in 2021. By hovering over the data points, we can see which regions the data aligns to.
                   <br>
                    <br>
                    An R<sup>2</sup> value of of 0.66 means that approximately 66% of the variation in average house prices can be explained by the date variable in the regression model. In other words, this suggests that about 66% of the fluctuations or changes observed in average house prices over time can be attributed to the chronological progression of dates in the dataset.

                <P>
                    The below graph shows the median house prices across different wards in Bristol between 1995 and 2023. You can adjust the slider at the bottom to view data for 
                    each year. There are 2 indicating marks, one showing where the University of Bristol is located, and where (most) students decide to live. 

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Using median prices instead of mean prices in house price analysis helps mitigate the impact of outliers, providing a more accurate representation of the typical price.
                    This approach is advantageous as it avoids distortion caused by extreme values, offering a more reliable measure of central tendency in skewed datasets.

            <h2>Now, lets understand the realm of Avocados</h2>

            <div class="para">
                <p>
                    Picture the world as a canvas, with reds akin to ripe sunsets, marking the lands that ship their creamy treasures to the UK, whilst patches of green signal avocado fields that are yet to be discovered by your favourite brunch eating influencer. 

                    <br><br>
                    Peru, South Africa and Costa Rica stand out prominently, depicted by a vivid sea of red on the map. These countries boast <a
                    href="https://www.fruitnet.com/eurofruit/peru-poised-for-big-rise-in-avocado-shipments/248308.article">robust agricultural sectors</a> and favorable climates, enabling them to produce substantial quantities of avocados destined for British shores. Their efficient supply chains and established trade agreements have positioned them as leading suppliers to the UK market. Conversely, other nations appear in varying shades of green and lighter hues, indicating relatively lower export volumes. While these countries may also cultivate avocados, factors such as logistical challenges or market dynamics may limit their export capacities compared to Peru and Costa Rica.

                    It's all well and good knowing that avocado's get flown from A to B, but are people really interested in them? The below graph, captured using Google trends data shows the volume of searches for "Avocado Toast"
                    over the last 10 years. We can see that interest peaked in 2020, but has remained relatively consistent since. Maybe avocado toast wasn't just a trend, and possibly it might be here to stay.

                    In this graph, we witness a clear illustration of the primary cost driver in the breakfast equation: the avocado. While the cost of toast remains relatively stable across different supermarkets, the price of avocados fluctuates significantly. This demonstrates that avocados exert a greater influence on the overall cost of avocado toast than the toast itself. Economic analysis reveals that factors such as seasonal availability, global demand, and 
                    supply chain dynamics contribute to the volatility in avocado prices. So, next time you ponder the price of your morning meal, remember: it's the avocado calling the shots, not the toast.

                <p>
                    The below graph illustrates two variables. The black dots and left sided Y axis represent the number of avocado toast meals that you could make
                    in relation to the average house price in the area. The white line and ride sided Y axis shows the inflation adjusted average cost to produce avocado toast at home.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    By analysing the black dots, we can see that at an absolute maximum, you'd be able to value your property at around 720,000 servings of avocodo toast. At the opposite end, 
                    around 50,000 servings would secure you your first home in the 90's. Who said your parents had it tough? Hovering over the graph will allow you to see the exact values for each ward
                    in Bristol. Would you trade your house for a supply of Avocado Toast?
                    <br><br>
                    On the other hand, we can see the average cost to produce avocado toast at home has increased steadily, in a similar trend to that of house prices. These values
                    have also been adjusted for inflation, allowing us to see the real values. You might have heard of the
                    <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/big-mac-index.asp">Big Mac index</a>, a way of measuring purchasing power parity between countries using the world's most well known
                    burger to compare global price standards. In an attempt to be more healthy, maybe "Avonomics" is the way to go.

                    Avocado coin could become a welcomed addition to these luring and enticing ways to increase your wealth with no risk whatsoever*. Existing meme coins include <a

                    <br>
                    Jokes aside, AvocadoCoin does aim to benefit the environment in many ways. They rely on 4th generation blockchain technologies, IoT, and Agro 4.0 to make the most of our resources and promote agro-green projects.
                    They aim to become a world benchmark in developing disruptive technologies applied to agriculture, and their goal is to enable the more efficient use of resources, apply crop monitoring in terms of irrigation, pest control, and other processes in the value chain that cause a third of the production to be lost.

                    Now, in some universe far, far away, they may not have the luxury of being able to import their avocados, so they might have to get their fix through Avocado Coin. The question is, how
                    would they fare? The below graph compares percentage changes in Avocado coin compared to Gold, Ethereum and the FTSE100 (hopefully you have heard of these, I will let you off for not knowing the meme coins).

                   The above graph looks a little bit confusing. You might be wondering why the graph isn't overly volatile, like most stocks can be. However, as we are looking at some of the most
                   widely traded commodities, it is reasonable to assume that changes would be minimal. Looking at the AvocadoCoin line, we can see a trend of negative percentage changes after it's inital increase. I think it's safe to say
                   that AvocadoCoin won't be fighting in the same league as Gold, Ethereum or the FTSE100 anytime soon, despite its good intentions.

                    The rise in popularity of avocados in recent years has resulted in this once lesser known fruit becoming a household
                    staple. If you are consuming an avocado toast serving every single day, then beside needing to vary your diet. you could be accumulating the funds instead to purchase a property.
                    Don't get your hopes up too quickly, as it would take approximately 960 years of eating avocado toast daily to purchase an average priced property in Bristol. Worst of all, by the time
                    960 years have passed, house prices will have likely increased too (or we will be living on the moon, I won't be around to tell you that though).

                    Avocado toast will remain as it is - a delicious brunch option for us all to enjoy. It is relatively cheap to produce, and as a result I would not recommend giving it up
                    if you are saving for your first deposit. Enjoy your avocado toast, because there are certainly better ways to save some money, especially if you are trying to enter the housing market.

            <h3>Figure 1: Regional House Prices in the UK 1986-2021. </h3>
            <p>This data was sourced using ONS data for house prices across different wards in Bristol. The data available was only up until 1986, so I could not go further back than this.
                Some of the data needed cleaning, as earlier years were represented quartely, but later years were yearly.
            </p>
            <h3>Figure 2: Median House Prices in Bristol Wards </h3>
            <p>This graph uses the aforementioned ward house price data, but is instead presented in an interactive map format. The map is created using a GeoJSON for Bristol wards.
                The biggest issue I faced here was that the lookup variable for wards required the same naming convention for both data sets (house price data and GeoJSON). This was an easy cleaning
                as it required that place names were aligned. Examples include respective data sets having "Clifton West" and "Clifton Village" which needed to be aligned.

            <p>This graph also uses a GeoJSON, but this time for a world map. Similar issues occured with the 2 data sets having slight different naming conventions. For example, one
                data set having Côte d'Ivoire and the other having Ivory Coast. This was easy to spot, as countries that weren't aligned appeared as blanks on the map. The mitigation involved
                going into the avocado export data and ensuring that the naming was aligned with the GeoJSON data.

            <h3>Figure 4: Avocado Exports to the UK by Country </h3>
            <p>This graph was created by manual research of the UK's biggest supermarkets. The same loaf of bread was used to formulate costs, as well as the cheapest option
                to purchase avocados.
            </p>
            <h3>Figure 5: How much would your house cost in avocados? </h3>
            <p>This graph is a combination of house price data and avocado cost data. However, I have used ONS provided inflation data to be able to adjust the cost to produce avocado toast
                to ensure that is it inflation adjusted.

            <h3>Figure 6: An alternate universe - How does an avocado themed CryptoCoin cope?</h3>
            <p>To create this graph, I used a jupyter notebook to extract data from Yahoo Finance. I imported pandas, numpy matplotlib and seaborn to do this.
                By using the yfinance import as well, I was able to extract informatiion for the stocks of my choice. I then cleaned this data using for loops to select the timeframes that I wanted.
                I was able to export this data using the to_csv which allowed me to visualise the data using vegalite. A link to the Jupyter notebook can be found <a
